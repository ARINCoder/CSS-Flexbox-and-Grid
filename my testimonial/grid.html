                        I honestly feel I got every pennys worth. </h1>
                    <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                        I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best -
                        and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                        careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

                    <h7> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them
                        and learning from their experiences was easy. </h7>
                    <p>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
                        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
                        capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention
                        you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</p>

                <h9 id="h9">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h9>
                <p id="p4">  Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
                    I needed some structure from professionals who 
                    <br>can help me learn programming step by step.
                     I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
                     a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
